# POTATOE-1

POTATOE-1 CPU documentation for architecture and binary machine code structure and generation/assembly.

## Architecture

Designed to be an 8 bit programmable mini-cpu with 16 bit ram-addresses. Basic arithmetic and logic functionality.<br>
Output via VGA signal (800x600 60Hz) with vram to store downscaled 4:3 with 200x150 pixels.<br>
Basic I/O with one byte size.

### Components

- 16 bit program counter with jump
- 4 general purpose 8 bit registers (addressed by 2 bits RR)
- ALU with 8 bit operations
    - arithmetic: add, sub, add with carry
    - logic: and, or, xor (logical not/invert with 0xFF)
- 16 bit addressable 8 bit RAM
- 16 bit addressable 8 bit VRAM
- 8 bit stack with 8 bit stackpointer (max size 255)

### Instructions

Instructions are one byte and followed by one or two more bytes which are buffered in the instruction register. <br>
Intructions consist of the following format:

<code>XXXXYURR BBBBBBBB [BBBBBBBBB]</code>

| bitID       | Description                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| XXXX        | the instruction identifier  |
| Y           | the mode of the instruction |
| U           | UNUSED                      |
| RR          | the register identifier     |
| BBBBBBBB    | buffered instruction byte   |

Instructions (XXXX) - Sub-Modes (Y): <br>
(* updates the flags registers)

| regID | Description                 |
| ----- | --------------------------- |
| 00    | A register                  |

## Micro-code assembler

When running the application with <code>-mc</code> it will generate the micro-code binary data in hex format. 
This code is used to drive the internal control logic of the CPU.

### Control-word

The control word is a 32 bit (4 byte) long sequence with the following format:

<code>H------- LLLIBBBP ---SSZMMN YYYAXRRE</code>

## Code assembler

When running the application with <code>-file=TEST-FILE.pot</code> the passed file will be parsed and converted to binary data in hex format.<br>
Whenever the passed file can not be assembled the output should be structured in the following format:

<code>ERROR|WARN (line:column): description</code>

Available commands can be found under section [instructions](#instructions).
